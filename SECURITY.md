# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support the following versions of Codename with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities through one of the following methods:

### GitHub Security Advisories (Preferred)

1. Go to the [Security Advisories](https://github.com/AnthemFlynn/codename/security/advisories) page
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the vulnerability report form
4. Submit the report

### Email

You can also email security reports to: `security@codename-ai.com`

Please include the following information in your report:

- **Type of issue** (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- **Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue**
- **The location of the affected source code** (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue**
- **Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue**
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Impact of the issue**, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

## Response Timeline

- **Initial Response:** Within 48 hours
- **Triage and Assessment:** Within 1 week
- **Fix Development:** Depends on severity and complexity
- **Security Advisory Publication:** After fix is available

## Security Measures

### Code Security

- **Static Analysis:** All code is scanned with Bandit for security issues
- **Dependency Scanning:** Dependencies are monitored with Safety
- **Code Review:** All changes require security review
- **Automated Testing:** Security tests run on every commit

### Secrets Isolation

Codename itself is designed for security:

- **Temporal Isolation:** Secrets are only exposed during specific execution phases
- **Sanitization:** Input data is sanitized before AI processing
- **Resolution:** Secrets are resolved only when needed
- **Zero Trust:** No assumptions about AI system behavior

### Infrastructure Security

- **CI/CD Security:** GitHub Actions with minimal permissions
- **Dependency Management:** Pinned dependencies with regular updates
- **Access Control:** Limited repository access with 2FA required
- **Audit Logging:** All security-relevant events are logged

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Configuration Security

```toml
# codename.toml - Secure configuration example
[security]
enforcement_mode = "strict"        # Always use strict mode in production
block_exposure = true             # Block any potential secret exposure
audit_logging = true              # Enable security audit logging

[secrets]
# Use environment variables or secure key management
api_keys = ["OPENAI_API_KEY", "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"]
```

### Usage Security

```python
import codename
import os

# ✅ Secure: Load secrets from environment
@codename.protect_secrets(['OPENAI_API_KEY'])
async def secure_ai_function(user_input: str) -> str:
    # AI sees sanitized input, gets real secrets during execution
    return await ai_workflow(user_input)

# ❌ Insecure: Hardcoded secrets
@codename.protect_secrets(['sk-1234567890abcdef'])  # Don't do this
async def insecure_function(user_input: str) -> str:
    return await ai_workflow(user_input)
```

### Environment Security

- **Production:** Use strict enforcement mode
- **Development:** Test with security scanning enabled
- **CI/CD:** Validate security configurations in pipelines
- **Monitoring:** Enable audit logging for security events

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations

1. **Memory Exposure:** Secrets exist in memory during resolution phase
2. **Process Isolation:** No protection against process memory dumps
3. **Logging:** Ensure logging systems don't capture resolved secrets
4. **Error Handling:** Exception messages may contain sensitive data

### Mitigation Strategies

- **Short-lived Secrets:** Minimize secret lifetime in memory
- **Secure Disposal:** Clear sensitive data from memory when possible
- **Error Sanitization:** Sanitize error messages before logging
- **Process Security:** Run in secure, isolated environments

## Security Updates

### Update Policy

- **Critical:** Immediate patch release
- **High:** Patch within 1-7 days
- **Medium:** Patch within 2-4 weeks
- **Low:** Patch in next minor release

### Notification Channels

- **GitHub Security Advisories:** Automatic notifications for repository watchers
- **Release Notes:** Security fixes documented in CHANGELOG.md
- **Email List:** Subscribe to security-announce@codename-ai.com (coming soon)

## Compliance and Standards

### Security Standards

- **OWASP:** Following OWASP Top 10 guidelines
- **NIST:** Aligned with NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- **ISO 27001:** Security controls based on ISO 27001

### Audit and Compliance

- **Code Audits:** Regular security code reviews
- **Dependency Audits:** Automated dependency vulnerability scanning  
- **Penetration Testing:** Periodic security assessments
- **Documentation:** Security controls documented and maintained
