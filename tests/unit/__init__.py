"""
Unit Tests for Cryptex AI

Pure unit tests for individual components in isolation.
These tests should be fast, focused, and have minimal dependencies.

Test Structure:
- core/: Tests for core engine and manager components
- decorators/: Tests for decorator implementations
- patterns/: Tests for pattern system components
- security/: Tests for security mechanisms

Each test module mirrors the source code structure for clarity.
